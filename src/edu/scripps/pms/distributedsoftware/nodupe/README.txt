Thank you for licensing NoDupe for use in your lab.

Here's how to install it on your PC:

1) Download the program:
   http://fields.scripps.edu/nodupe/NoDupe-20030515.zip

2) Extract the Zip into the directory C:\NoDupe on your hard disk.
   The password is "clone" to open the zip.

3) Copy "NoDupe.bat" to your c:\windows or c:\winnt directory.

To use the program, go to a directory of MS2 files (see
