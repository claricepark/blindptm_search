Thank you for licensing SQTSort for use in your lab.

Here's how to install it:

1) To use SQTSort, download this file:
   http://fields.scripps.edu/SQTSort-20030515.zip

2) Extract the Zip into the directory c:\SQTSort on your hard disk.
   The password is "scrumptious" to extract the files.

3) Copy the file SQTSort.bat to your c:\windows or c:\winnt directory.

When you need to sort the identifications within the SQT file found in
the current directory, just type "SQTSort" at the command prompt and
hit enter.
