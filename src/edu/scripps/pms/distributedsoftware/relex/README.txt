Thank you for licensing RelEx for use in your lab.

Here's how to install it on your computer:

1) Download the program:
   http://fields.scripps.edu/relex/relex.zip

2) Extract the zip on your hard disk. The password is "denver"
to open the zip.

3) Copy "ExtractChro.dll" to your c:\windows or c:\winnt directory.

4) The other two files can go in any directory, as long as they are
together in the same directory.

5) Depending on the version of Windows that you are running, you might
have to install a Visual Basic virtual machine library and/or add a
commondialog box library. Furthermore, the extraction of data from
Xcalibur RAW files requires that the user has Xcalibur running on the
same machine (the ocx control calls the RawFile.dll library of Xcalibur).

There is no documentation written up yet, so if you need details on
how to run the program please contact its author, Michael MacCoss,
at maccoss@gs.washington.edu. If you have problems downloading and/or
opening the zip file, please contact me.
